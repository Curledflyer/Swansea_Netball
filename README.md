# Swansea_Netball
This project will be a simple website to be used by a Netball league in Swansea.
This will have a simple design with basic elements required by a sports page.
Implementation and maintanence of a league table will be the main challenge.
This will need to be done well enough that the table and fixtures can easily be maintained by somebody
without access to/changing any of the code.
